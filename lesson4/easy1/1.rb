Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are, how can you find out what class
they belong to?

1. true
2. "hello"
3. [1, 2, 3, "happy days"]
4. 142

1. true is a boolean object of 'TrueClass'
2. "hello" is a string object of class 'String'
3. [1, 2, 3, "happy days"] is an array object of class 'Array'
4. 142 is an integer object of class 'Integer'

all of these can have the .class method called on them to return the class
